<h2>What the heck are we doing</h2>

<p>The idea is to build a digital manager for performance artists. It starts with the professionals to serve the newcomers, but also get paid for their skills.This platform would provide them with:
<h4>Priority 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>An online profile</li>
<li>A way to connect and cross-publish to multiple social media sites</li>
</ul>

<h4>Priority 2</h4>
<li>Secure video uploading &amp; payment methods</li>
<li>Faceted Searching for free &amp; secure content</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There is obviously a lot more we can do, but these are the initial thoughts of the direction to take this. Please add any thoughts</p>
